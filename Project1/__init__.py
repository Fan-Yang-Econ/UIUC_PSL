# CARET
# randomForest, xgboost, GBM, lightGBM
# glmnet
# ggplot2
#
# Python packages:
# pandas
# scipy

# A report (3 pages maximum, PDF or HTML) that provides
#
# technical details ( e.g., pre-processing, implementation details if not trivial) for the models you use, and
#
# any interesting findings from your analysis.
#
# In addition, report the accuracy on the test data (see evaluation metric given below), running time of your code and the computer system you use (e.g., Macbook Pro, 2.53 GHz, 4GB memory, or AWS t2.large) for the 10 training/test splits. You do not need to submit the part of the code that evaluates test accuracy.
#
# In your report, describe the techincal details of your code, summarize your findings, and do not copy-and-paste your code to the report.
